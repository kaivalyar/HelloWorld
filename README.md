# HelloWorld
The "Hello World" code, in different languages.

## Synopsis
The Hello World program is a rudimentary metric of measuring the simplicity of each language. It is also the first program most people code when learning a language. These two features make a repository of Hello World codes uniquely useful. It serves as a learning environment, serving to incentivize and otherwise showcase languages that may be used to program computers. More importantly, though, it serves to comapre languages with one another. This is especially easy to see with github's display of the languages used in each repository. Since the code here in each language achieves the exact same purpose, it is easy to see how long each language takes to perform the same task.
